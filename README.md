# VideoApp
The app includes information about videos (movies and series).

There is a search feature based on the video name, where videos can be added to or removed from the room database.

The videos trailer is played using ExoPlayer.

ExoPlayer is customized with a custom controller.

Movies and series come filtered using ViewPager2. (Not finished)
